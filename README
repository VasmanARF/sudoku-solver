# Sudoku Solver

This is a Python project that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm along with 3 heuristics (Naked Singles, Hidden Singles, Minimum Remaining Vales Heuristic). The program can take in any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle and provide the correct solution.

## characteristics
- Solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- Sudokus must be in the format of a 9x9 Numpy Array
- Simple and clean algorithm implementation.
- Blank Spaces in Sudokus provided must be represented by a zero
- If a provided Sudoku has no solution or is invalid a 9x9 numpy array of "-1"'s will be returned 


## Installation
